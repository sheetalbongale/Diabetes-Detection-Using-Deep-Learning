# Diabetes Detection Using Keras

## Objective: 
This is a simple binary classification problem to detect an onset of diabetes. This is my first project to use neural network in Keras. 

## Data:
[dataset](data/pima-indians-diabetes.csv)
In this Keras project, I am using the Pima Indians onset of diabetes dataset. 
It describes patient medical record data for Pima Indians and whether they had an onset of diabetes within five years.

## Steps to take:
1. Load Data.
2. Define Keras Model.
3. Compile Keras Model.
4. Fit Keras Model.
5. Evaluate Keras Model.
6. Make Predictions.
